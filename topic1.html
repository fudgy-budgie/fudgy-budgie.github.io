                    I’m not experienced with front-end development, so I used a combination of Large Language Models (LLMs) and resources from W3Schools to create this website. The HTML and CSS structure of the site was created by prompting ChatGPT v.5.2 and v.5-Mini for code snippets. After combining the code snippets, I identified any problems with the code and prompted the model again to resolve the errors. The fine-tuning of dimensional variables is mostly done with the assistance of the LLM; other CSS variables are corrected manually to achieve my desired look of the website.

                    The contents of the posts are all authored by me, and no text in this blog is generated from LLMs. AI was only used to identify where grammatical mistakes are in my writing. I used the free plan of Grammarly to identify minor errors in my writing (e.g., misspellings, missing punctuation), and major grammatical errors (e.g., run-on sentences) were corrected by completely rewriting the sentence. I completely rewrote the sentences to avoid using words generated by Grammarly. I do not want AI Voice in my writing.

                    The images in this blog are taken by me or someone I know. If any images are sourced from online, I credit the source. I have audited each source of the image to ensure that no generative images from a Machine Learning Model (MLM) were used. Early builds of the website use two placeholder images taken from the web. The images placeholder1.png and placeholder2.png were originally sourced from commons.wikimedia.org and firstbenefits.org, respectively. They have since been replaced with my own assets.

                    In summary, the structure of the website is built using code snippets generated from LLMs. All written content and images are original and AI-free. Grammar is checked by an MLM like Grammarly, but no automatic suggestions for major mistakes were used in my writing. I am against the use of AI for generating creative materials. If I get the chance, I will ask a friend to rebuild my blog website with human-authored code. This AI Use Disclosure section will be updated regularly when changes occur.

                <p class="post-text">
                    Since all written content and unsourced images are original, I do not permit anyone to use my written content and unsourced images (unless it is allowed by fair use). I disallow the utilization of any of my written content and original images for training LLMs and MLMs.
