                    Ever since short-form content has flooded social media, I have wanted to avoid this new avenue of doomscrolling. I have also grown tired of being advertised to all the time, having to watch AI-slop content, and giving up my rights and privacy in exchange for <em>free</em> digital services ("If it's free, you are the product"). I joined social media sites originally to stay connected with friends after graduating from middle school and to show off my artistic creations. But over the years, it has become incredibly annoying and difficult to do any of it without risking falling into the short-form content trap. My only holdouts now are YouTube and Discord. I also check Twitter and Instagram once every two weeks for organizational announcements. The only site that I don’t think I can leave is LinkedIn. It is imperative in the modern job-seeking market, but it is a huge privacy concern!

                    This blog is my solution to still being able to share my projects without coming into contact with social media algorithms and doomscrolling potential. It also has the added benefit of moderate anonymity and freedom to present my work in whatever way I want.
                </p>

                <p class="post-text">
                    I hope you, the reader, will enjoy the contents of this blog and find the motivation to move off social media as well. I encourage you to join me in democratizing the internet once again by lessening our dependence on large digital service companies C:.

                    I’m not experienced with front-end development, so I used a combination of Large Language Models (LLMs) and resources from W3Schools to create this website. The HTML and CSS structure of the site was created by prompting ChatGPT v.5.2 and v.5-Mini for code snippets. After combining the code snippets, I identified any problems with the code and prompted the model again to resolve the errors. The fine-tuning of dimensional variables is mostly done with the assistance of the LLM; other CSS variables are corrected manually to achieve my desired look of the website.

                    The contents of the posts are all authored by me, and no text in this blog is generated from LLMs. AI was only used to identify where grammatical mistakes are in my writing. I used the free plan of Grammarly to identify minor errors in my writing (e.g., misspellings, missing punctuation), and major grammatical errors (e.g., run-on sentences) were corrected by completely rewriting the sentence. I completely rewrote the sentences to avoid using words generated by Grammarly. I do not want AI Voice in my writing.

                    The images in this blog are taken by me or someone I know. If any images are sourced from online, I credit the source. I have audited each source of the image to ensure that no generative images from a Machine Learning Model (MLM) were used. Early builds of the website use two placeholder images taken from the web. The images placeholder1.png and placeholder2.png were originally sourced from commons.wikimedia.org and firstbenefits.org, respectively. They have since been replaced with my own assets.

                    <strong>In summary, the structure of the website is built using code snippets generated from LLMs. All written content and images are original and AI-free. Grammar is checked by an MLM like Grammarly, but no automatic suggestions for major mistakes were used in my writing. I am against the use of AI for generating creative materials. If I get the chance, I will ask a friend to rebuild my blog website with human-authored code. This AI Use Disclosure section will be updated regularly when changes occur.</strong>

                    <strong>Since all written content and unsourced images are original, I do not permit anyone to use my written content and unsourced images (unless it is allowed by fair use). I disallow the utilization of any of my written content and original images for training LLMs and MLMs.</strong>
